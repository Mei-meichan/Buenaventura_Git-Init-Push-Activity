    <p>The Raspberry Pi is a debit card-sized low-cost computer that connects to a computer Desktop or TV and uses a standard mouse and Keyboard. It has a dedicated processor, memory, and a graphics driver, just like a PC. </p>
    <p>The Raspberry Pi launched in 2012, and there have been several iterations and variations released since then. The original Pi had a single-core 700MHz CPU and just 256MB RAM, and the latest model has a quad-core CPU clocking in at over 1.5GHz, and 4GB RAM. The price point for Raspberry Pi has always been under $100 (usually around $35 USD), most notably the Pi Zero, which costs just $5.</p>
