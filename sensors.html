<body>
    <p>Sensors capture and translate their physical attributes into observable electrical impulses from chosen surroundings. Temperature, mass, speed, pressure, or heat bodies such as people are included as these attributes. A microprocessor processes the electrical impulses to provide outputs that correspond to a set of measures. The system sends the output to the recipients in the designated devices.</p>
