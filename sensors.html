    <p>Sensors capture and translate their physical attributes into observable electrical impulses from chosen surroundings. Temperature, mass, speed, pressure, or heat bodies such as people are included as these attributes. A microprocessor processes the electrical impulses to provide outputs that correspond to a set of measures. The system sends the output to the recipients in the designated devices.</p>
    <p>Sensors play a pivotal role in the internet of things (IoT). They make it possible to create an ecosystem for collecting and processing data about a specific environment so it can be monitored, managed and controlled more easily and efficiently.</p>
    <p>Most sensors have a linear transfer function. The sensitivity is then defined as the ratio between the output signal and measured property</p>
